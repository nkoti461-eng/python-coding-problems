#Assignment Operation
# Write a Python program that:
# Initializes a variable a = 5.
# Performs all the following assignment operations step-by-step:
# += 3
# -= 3
# *= 3
# /= 3
# %= 3
# //= 3
# **= 3
# &=
# ^=
# >>=
# <<=
# After each operation, print the updated value of a.
# Finally, print:
# The final value of a
# The datatype of a
... a = 5
... print(f"Assignment oper of Assignment Operator: {a}")
... a += 3
... print(f"Assignment oper of Addition Assignment: {a}")
... a -= 3
... print(f"Assignment oper of Subtraction Assignment: {a}")
... a *= 3
... print(f"Assignment oper of Multiplication Assignment: {a}")
... a /= 3
... print(f"Assignment oper of Division Assignment: {a}")
... a %= 3
... print(f"Assignment oper of Modulus Assignment: {a}")
... a //= 3
... print(f"Assignment oper of Floor Division Assignment: {a}")
... a **= 3
... print(f"Assignment oper of Exponentiation Assignment: {a}")

... #Comparison Operation
... # Write a Python program that:
... # 1:Takes two numbers as input from the user.
... # 2:Compares both numbers using:
... # >Equal to
... # >Not equal to
... # >Greater than
... # >Less than
... # >Greater than or equal to
... # >Less than or equal to
... # 3:Prints all results clearly.
